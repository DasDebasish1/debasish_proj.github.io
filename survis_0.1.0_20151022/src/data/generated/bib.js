In pediatric medicine, it aids in the growth and development assessment of various diseases affecting children. In forensic medicine, it is required to determine criminal liability by age, refugee age estimation, and child-adult discrimination. In such cases, radiologists or forensic medicine specialists conduct bone age estimation from left hand-wrist radiographs using atlas methods that require time and effort. This study aims to develop a computer-based decision support system using a new modified deep learning approach to accelerate radiologists' workflow for pediatric bone age estimation from wrist radiographs. The KCRD dataset created by us was used to test the proposed method. The performance of the proposed modified IncepitonV3 model compared to IncepitonV3, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB7 models.

        "abstract": "Deep learning technology has rapidly evolved in recent years. Bone age assessment BAA is a typical object detection and classification problem that would benefit from deep learning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variants are hence increasingly used for automating BAA, and they have shown promising results. In this paper, we propose a complete end-to-end BAA system to automate the entire process of the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method, starting from localization of the epiphysis-metaphysis growth regions within 13 different bones and ending with estimation of the corresponding BA. Specific modifications to the CNNs and other stages are proposed to improve results. In addition, an annotated database of 3300 X-ray images is built to train and evaluate the system. The experimental results show that the average top-1 and top-2 prediction accuracies for skeletal bone maturity levels for 13 regions of interest are 79.6 and 97.2 percent, respectively. The mean absolute error and root mean squared error in age prediction are 0.46 years and 0.62 years, respectively, and accuracy within one year of the ground truth of 97.6 percent is achieved. The proposed system is shown to outperform a commercially available Greulich-Pyle-based system, demonstrating the potential for practical clinical use.",

        "abstract": "Bone age assessment (BAA) based on X-ray imaging of the left hand and wrist can accuratelyre\ufb02ect the degree of the body\u2019s physiological development and physical condition. However, thetraditional manual evaluation method relies too much on inef\ufb01cient specialist labor. In this paper,to propose automatic BAA, we introduce a hierarchical convolutional neural network to detect theregions of interest (ROI) and classify the bone grade. Firstly, we establish a dataset of children\u2019s BAAcontaining 2518 left hand X-rays. Then, we use the \ufb01ne-grained classi\ufb01cation to obtain the grade of theregion of interest via object detection. Speci\ufb01cally, \ufb01ne-grained classi\ufb01ers are based on context-awareattention pooling (CAP). Finally, we perform the model assessment of bone age using the thirdversion of the Tanner\u2013Whitehouse (TW3) methodology. The end-to-end BAA system provides boneage values, the detection results of 13 ROIs, and the bone maturity of the ROIs, which are convenientfor doctors to obtain information for operation. Experimental results on the public dataset and clinicaldataset show that the performance of the proposed method is competitive. The accuracy of bonegrading is 86.93 percent, and the mean absolute error (MAE) of bone age is7.68 monthson the clinicaldataset. On public dataset, the MAE is 6.53 months.

        "abstract": "Hand bone age, as the biological age of humans, can accurately reflect the development level and maturity of individuals. Bone age assessment results of adolescents can provide a theoretical basis for their growth and development and height prediction. In this study, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on fine-grained image classification is proposed, using a hand bone image dataset provided by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) as the research object. This model can automatically locate informative regions and extract local features in the process of hand bone image recognition, and then, the extracted local features are combined with global features of a complete image for bone age classification. This method can achieve end-to-end bone age assessment without any image annotation information (except bone age tags), improving the speed and accuracy of bone age assessment. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 66.38 and 68.63 percent recognition accuracy of males and females on the RSNA dataset, and the mean absolute errors are 3.71 \u00b1 7.55 and 3.81 \u00b1 7.74 months for males and females, respectively. The test time for each image is approximately 35 ms. This method achieves good performance and outperforms existing methods in bone age assessment based on weakly supervised fine-grained image classification.",

        "abstract": "Assessment of skeletal maturity is important for a clinician to make a decision of the most appropriate treatment on various skeletal disorders. This task is very challenging when using machine learning method due to the limited data and large anatomical variations among different subjects. In this article, we propose an ensemble-based deep learning pipeline to automatically assess the distal radius and ulna (DRU) maturity from left-hand radiographs. At the same time, we adapted the concept of densely connected mechanism in the proposed network architecture to reuse features and prevent gradient disappearance. Therefore, the model acquires two convincing advantages: first, our model preserves the maximum information flow and has a much faster convergence rate. Second, our model avoids overfitting even if training with limited data. The experimental dataset contains 1189 left-hand X -ray scans of children and teenagers. The proposed method achieves 85.27 and 91.68 percent for radius and ulna classification, respectively. Extensive experiments prove that our model performs better than using other network structures.",

        "abstract": "Rapid and accurate measurement of bone age from hand X-ray images is a significant task for children\u2019s maturity assessment and metabolic disorders diagnosis. With the development of deep learning technology, assessment methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become mainstream. However, the existing CNN method generates the assessment results solely based on images, which ignores the clinical practice and thus weakens the evaluation performance. In this article, an automatic bone age assessment method based on CNN and graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed. The overall method uses CNN for feature extraction and GCN for bone key regions inference, which mimics the physician\u2019s clinical process. Specifically, the key regions of the hand bone are first defined according to the clinical standard. Then, independent CNN pathways are established to extract the features of different key regions. Finally, a novel region aggregation GCN (RAGCN) is designed, which can aggregate the region features into the overall bone age representation according to the adjacency relation of the regions. In addition, RAGCN can also infer the importance of different regions in the feature aggregation process. The proposed method is validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) dataset and the Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) dataset. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 4.09 months on the RSNA dataset and 6.78 months on the RHPE dataset, it is competitive and superior to other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Skeletal bone age assessment using X-ray images is a standard clinical procedure to detect any anomaly in bone growth among kids and babies. The assessed bone age indicates the actual level of growth, whereby a large discrepancy between the assessed and chronological age might point to a growth disorder. Hence, skeletal bone age assessment is used to screen the possibility of growth abnormalities, genetic problems, and endocrine disorders. Usually, the manual screening is assessed through X-ray images of the non-dominant hand using the Greulich\u2013Pyle (GP) or Tanner\u2013Whitehouse (TW) approach. The GP uses a standard hand atlas, which will be the reference point to predict the bone age of a patient, while the TW uses a scoring mechanism to assess the bone age using several regions of interest information. However, both approaches are heavily dependent on individual domain knowledge and expertise, which is prone to high bias in inter and intra-observer results. Hence, an automated bone age assessment system, which is referred to as Attention-Xception Network (AXNet) is proposed to automatically predict the bone age accurately. The proposed AXNet consists of two parts, which are image normalization and bone age regression modules. The image normalization module will transform each X-ray image into a standardized form so that the regressor network can be trained using better input images. This module will first extract the hand region from the background, which is then rotated to an upright position using the angle calculated from the four key-points of interest. Then, the masked and rotated hand image will be aligned such that it will be positioned in the middle of the image. Both of the masked and rotated images will be obtained through existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The last module will then predict the bone age through the Attention-Xception network that incorporates multiple layers of spatial-attention mechanism to emphasize the important features for more accurate bone age prediction. From the experimental results, the proposed AXNet achieves the lowest mean absolute error and mean squared error of 7.699 months and 108.869 months2, respectively. Therefore, the proposed AXNet has demonstrated its potential for practical clinical use with an error of less than one year to assist the experts or radiologists in evaluating the bone age objectively.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric bone age assessment (BAA) is a common clinical technique for evaluating children's endocrine, genetic, and growth disorders. However, the deep learning BAA method based on global images neglects fine-grained concerns, and regions of interest (ROIs) need additional annotation and complex processing. To overcome these shortcomings, we proposed an interpretable deep-learning architecture based on multiple-instance learning to address BAA efficiently without additional annotations. We cropped the entire image into small patches and got patch features by feature extraction network. Then, an attention backbone ranked feature vectors of the entire image and aggregates its information according to its relative importance. Finally, each image's features and gender were aggregated to predict bone age. The proposed method can identify ROIs by attention-based multi-instance aggregation without additional labels and produce interpretable heatmaps. Moreover, by cropping the complete image into patches and reducing the dimensionality, the proposed model can notice the fine-grained information of the image and improve the model training speed. We validated the proposed method in the Radiological Society of North America 2017 dataset. The results showed that the proposed model achieved an advanced performance of MAE 4.17 months. Furthermore, the visualization results indicated that the proposed model was highly interpretable, which can localize the ROIs without spatial labeling. In conclusion, a novel method for high performance and interpretable bone age prediction without additional manual annotations has been developed, which can be used to effectively assess the pediatric's bone age.",
